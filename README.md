## The weather app displays weather data for the location entered in the search bar or by obtaining the location of the deviceif user allows location access

- The units of the weather data are in metric by default, but can be switched to imperial based on user's preference with a toggle button provided.
- The preferred unit of the user is saved so the user won't have to select it again on reload.
- The user input is screened to prevent useless HTTP requests.

## Built With

- ### Semantic HTML5 markup
- ### CSS custom properties
  - Pseudo-selectors (hover; to add hover effect to certain elements)
  - Pseudo-elements
  - Position property
  - Media queries to make page responsive for mobile
  - `Flexbox`
  - Transition property
  - Animation
  - `Box-Shadow` & `Text-Shadow` Properties.

- OpenWeatherMap Api, Geo-location Api, Geo-coder Api,

- ### JavaScript

- Implemented DOM manipulation in various parts of the project to make page dynamic.
- JS `Objects`, `Arrays`, & `Arrays of objects` to store data of similar items.
- Used Arrow Functions, `spread operators`  and `{ object destructuring}` methods to match the modern conventions.
- Made use of various `JS` objects and methods such as; `node.createElement()`, `node.AppendChild()`, `node.replaceChild()`, etc.
- Implemented `array.forEach()`, through the course of the project to loop through `objects` in the `Objects Array`; thus making it possible to manipulate the objects and produce desired result.
- Made use of `if Statements` to match specific use cases.
- Implement the use of `eventListeners` to make 'add' & 'remove' buttons functional.
- The `node.localStorage` `set()` & `get()` methods were used to store and retrieve user inputs.
- Made use of the `HTMLCollection` API with DOM selector `document.querySelectorAll()` to manipulate a list of elements with same class.
- Implement `JS - Class` with static methods.
- Fetch API
- Promise and callbacks using (Async and Await.)

- WEBPACK
- Implement webpack with various plugins to bundle `js`, minify `css`, and create a `HTMl` template.
- Split `webpack` config into two modes `production` and `development`.
- Create a common webpack config and use a `webpack-merge` plugin to keep things `DRY` in production and development configs.
- Load `DateTime` from `luxon` library.
- The Google `workbox` plugin is used to precache application shell to make it work offline
- Various webpack plugins were used for this project.

  - HTMLWebpackPlugin
  - MiniCssExtractPlugin
  - OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin
  - CssMinimizerPlugin
  - CleanWebpackPlugin
  - WorkboxWebpackPlugin
  - CopyPlugin
  - TerserPlugin to minimize bundle size

- Service Worker
